    <h1>Prisoner's Dilemma</h1>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">
      <p>
        The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely
        rational
        individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was
        originally
        framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game
        with
        prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma", presenting it as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no
        means of
        communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal
        charge, but
        they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a
        bargain.
        Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the
        crime, or
        to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The offer is:
        <ul>
          <li>If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison</li>
          <li>If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison (and vice
            versa)</li>
          <li>If A and B both remain silent, both of them will only serve one year in prison (on the lesser charge).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
